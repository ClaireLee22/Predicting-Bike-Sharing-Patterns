# Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Patterns
Neural Network Project [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree]

## Project Overview
### Project Description
Build a neural network from scratch and use it to predict daily bike rental ridership. 

### Project Procedure
- Explore the data
- Preprocesse the data
  - Transfered skewed continous features
  - One-hot encoding
- Evaluate performance of several supervised learning algorithms
  - Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
  - Decision Trees
  - Ensemble Methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNeighbors)
  - Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDC)
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Logistic Regression
- Choose the best model
- Tune model parameters using grid search
- Evaluate feature importance to optimize the model's performance
  - feature_importances_  attribute 
  - recursive feature elimination(RFE)

### Project Results
 

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

### Run
In a terminal or command window, run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook Your_first_neural_network.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook Your_first_neural_network.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
