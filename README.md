# Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Patterns
Neural Network Project [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree]

## Project Overview
### Project Description
Build a neural network from scratch and use it to predict daily bike rental ridership. 

### Project Procedure
- Explore the data
- Preprocesse the data
  - Transfered skewed continous features
  - One-hot encoding
- Evaluate performance of several supervised learning algorithms
- Choose the best model
- Tune model parameters using grid search
- Evaluate feature importance to optimize the model's performance
  - feature_importances_  attribute 
  - recursive feature elimination(RFE)

### Project Results
 

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)


### Run
In a terminal or command window, run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook Your_first_neural_network.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook Your_first_neural_network.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data
Download data from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset)
